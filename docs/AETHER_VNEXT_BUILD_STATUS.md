# AETHER vNext — Build Status

**AETHER TRACE:** 2026-09-25 23:55 EDT  
**Branch:** `aether-vnext-swapout`  
**Draft PR:** #12  
**Legacy baseline:** `879736630edf5f41ede90258a4596bf3fff8c053`

## Authority

1. AETHER Firm Master Blueprint v5.0
2. AETHER Playbook Pack v1.4 FULL
3. AETHER Pre-Code Freeze v1.0

Legacy implementation behavior has no design authority over vNext.

## Phase status

### Phase 0 — isolation + freeze loader: COMPLETE

Evidence:
- isolated `backend/aether_vnext/` package;
- static test rejects any `app` / `app.*` import from vNext;
- PAPER ONLY and LIVE BLOCKED contract is asserted in CI;
- frozen source fingerprints, state namespaces, risk defaults, product-side truth,
  crypto-short disablement, ZN execution truth, and allocator-v1 constants are
  encoded;
- PostgreSQL namespace `aether_vnext` is reserved through Alembic revision 0002;
- vNext runtime manifest is configuration-hash bound;
- AETHER vNext CI is green.

### Phase 1 — canonical types: COMPLETE

Implemented:
- MarketObservation;
- Setup;
- Ticket;
- OrderIntent;
- OpenTrade / ClosedTrade;
- ReviewCard;
- GovernorStateRecord;
- PolicySnapshot;
- BrokerAccountLedger;
- EventLedgerRecord;
- typed ExitPlan and precedence;
- deterministic route_id / position_key / signal_key / idempotency_key;
- canonical reason-code vocabulary;
- ProfitabilityEvidence;
- Alpha Factory objects from F-006;
- News-Market Intelligence objects from F-007.

All vNext tests remain isolated from legacy runtime imports.

### Phase 2 — registry + clocks / market truth: COMPLETE

Implemented:
- full canonical Product Registry row contract across the 12 seed assets;
- explicit product-side truth, shortability/locate state, quantity and price physics,
  margin model, fee schedule, calendar identity, lifecycle, execution/data bindings;
- futures continuous-research versus executable-contract separation;
- exact `current_contract`, expiry, next-contract and 48-hour roll-cutoff binding;
- automatic futures roll prohibited;
- binding Part III seed product math for all 12 assets;
- later Part III US10Y/ZN execution truth retained; superseded yield×$1000 execution
  math is not implemented;
- fee/cost calculations for Kraken, tastyfx, Ninja micros and IBKR equities;
- USDJPY quote-cost conversion to USD;
- 5 bps adverse paper slip, spread cost, 1.25 default cost hurdle and strict READY
  inequality;
- equity short borrow charged only to short trades;
- authoritative calendar scheduler interface with DST conversion through
  America/New_York;
- holiday/early-close state supplied by a date-specific calendar provider;
- non-crypto schedules refuse to assume a holiday state when that provider is absent;
- FX rollover maintenance, futures daily maintenance and early-close blocking;
- MarketObservation hard-validity helper with caller-supplied stale threshold;
- completed-bar law using exchange timestamp first, two-second receive grace only
  when exchange timestamp is unavailable, and session-close handling;
- explicit BOUND/UNBOUND data-source state rather than invented provider identities;
- Product Registry, cost, calendar, roll, side-support and anti-invention tests.

Phase 2 completion evidence:
- AETHER vNext CI run #44: SUCCESS.
- 53 isolated vNext tests passed.
- repository-wide CI was checked separately and remains red only on the five known
  unchanged legacy sleeve/portfolio tests tracked as AETH-VN-001.
- AETH-VN-002 records the intentional external source/calendar/contract binding
  dependency that blocks FIRE until later adapter phases bind it.

## CI state

### vNext CI

GREEN on the current replacement code path.

### Repository-wide legacy CI

Known baseline defect AETH-VN-001 remains visible:
5 legacy sleeve/portfolio tests fail while 312 pass. The failing source and tests
are byte-identical between main and the replacement branch, proving the failure was
not introduced by vNext. This defect is CONTAINED and BLOCKS final merge, but does
not control vNext design.

## Current safety

- production `main` is untouched by vNext;
- no vNext production deployment;
- no live orders;
- no forced strategy entries;
- no vNext strategy implementation yet;
- no legacy evidence imported into vNext;
- PR #12 remains DRAFT.

## Next build target

Phase 3 — vNext Firm book + persistence projections:
- append-only EventLedger persistence;
- canonical current-state projection tables;
- Setup/Ticket/OrderIntent/OpenTrade/ClosedTrade/ReviewCard persistence;
- broker-account ledgers and reservations;
- signal-key consumption and idempotency persistence;
- Governor/Policy snapshots;
- restart/rebuild contract;
- no legacy-state migration into vNext evidence.

Strategy conversion remains intentionally later.
